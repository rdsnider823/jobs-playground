EBAC strives to reduce barriers that contribute to disparities in wellness for socio-economically disadvantaged and racially marginalized families and to create communities where all children and families have support systems to reach their full potential.
EBAC was established in 1952 when a group of parents of children with autism wanted to give their children the same educational and recreational opportunities that contribute to the physical well-being and social growth of all children. From this was born the first day-treatment program west of the Mississippi and was the foundation of growth in meeting the needs of children and families living in the San Francisco Bay Area, and especially in Alameda County.
Today, EBAC’s programs serve over 10,000 children, youth and families throughout Alameda County each year with the goal of giving each child and family the specific resources, skills, and support they need to help them reach their full potential.

Reporting to the IBH Senior Director, the I-SBBH Program Director provides administrative and clinical leadership and oversight to school-based mental health services for children, families and communities in school sites throughout Alameda County.
Intensive Counseling Enriched classrooms are dual educational and therapeutic classrooms that enable children to learn techniques for self-regulating their emotions and behavior while receiving academic instruction. An EBAC mental health clinician works with each child to achieve goals based upon his or her individualized treatment plan. Behavioral health counselors provide in-classroom and milieu rehabilitation services, providing real-time intervention and affirmation, to support positive behavioral changes and self-regulation.
EPIC is an intensive 25-week program for Medi-Cal eligible children ages 3.5-6 who have difficulty self-regulating their emotions and behaviors. Featuring social emotional learning, occupational therapy, and family-centered play therapy, EPIC offers children and their families skill building services to improve children’s capacity to self-regulate and respond age appropriately and increase families’ knowledge of child development and build a community of support.

Liaise with various stakeholders, clients, partners, and funders on relevant data, impact, and performance measurement issues;
Address any other tasks assigned by the CEO or COO;
Given the nature of the work, staff are expected to be flexible and may be asked to carry out duties which are not specifically listed above. The job description may be revised after discussion between the staff member and the organization; and
Other duties as assigned by the CEO or COO.
Reporting Relationships
This position does not have any full-time staff directly reporting to them.
QUALIFICATIONS:

Mellon Fellowships,National Park Service Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow: African Americans in Pacific Maritime History,unspecified,"Job Description
Job Description:\n\nPlease note: This position will continue accepting applications until either the position is filled or December 31, 2023.  -------------------- The National Park Service (NPS) Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellowship Program places recent humanities PhDs with NPS sites and programs across the agency. In collaboration with NPS staff and partners, the incoming cohort of Mellon Humanities Fellows will complete original research projects, and develop new interpretive and educational programming, helping the agency connect more people to places that matter by incorporating new sources and perspectives into its storytelling.  The Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellowship Program is a signature element of the National Park Service's commemoration of the 250th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, during which the Park Service will join with other agencies and all Americans to celebrate and contemplate the meaning of the Declaration of Independence and its relevance to our lives today. As the steward of our nation's parks, heritage sites, and special places, NPS is committed to learning from the complex and challenging histories contained within them, building toward a future of freedom and possibility for all Americans.  This opportunity is generously supported by a generous grant from the Mellon Foundation through the National Park Foundation (NPF). The project is administered via a three-way agreement among NPS, National Park Foundation (NPF), and American Conservation Experience (ACE). Job Title: National Park Service Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow: African Americans in Pacific Maritime History Employer:  American Conservation Experience (ACE) Department: EPIC Program, National Park Service (NPS) DivisionLocation: San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park (SAFR), San Francisco, California. The Fellow will need to be on site at least part-time and should live within a reasonable commuting distance. A partially remote/teleworking arrangement is possible.Status: Temporary, Full-time, Exempt Term: Position is fully funded through August 31, 2026 Start Date: On or about August 26, 2024 Host Description:  SAFR encompasses 50 acres on the city's northern waterfront, in the Fisherman's Wharf neighborhood, and includes the Aquatic Park Historic District, a National Historic Landmark. It was founded in 1988, charged by Congress with preserving and interpreting ""the history and achievements of seafaring Americans and of the Nation's maritime heritage, especially on the Pacific Coast."" Because the Park's resources are primarily non-military, interpretation at SAFR usually tends in the same direction. The Park property includes historic ships and boats (six of which are National Historic Landmarks), museum and research collections, exhibition spaces, open spaces, and a large bathhouse built by the WPA for the people of San Francisco in 1939. Hyde Street Pier is home to two square-rigged sailing ships, two steam tugs, and a massive historic ferryboat, all preserved and floating on the water of San Francisco Bay. The Visitor Center, in a historic cannery building, provides a location for the exhibition of selections from SAFR's museum collections. The Sala Burton Maritime Museum Building, a WPA gem built in the streamline moderne style, features its original maritime-themed murals and artwork by Hilaire Hiler, Sargent Johnson, Beniamino Bufano, and others. It serves also as an exhibition space and site for public events, including talks and monthly chantey sings. Open spaces include two small greenspace parks, a bocce ball court, and the tiny strip of sandy beach known as Aquatic Park.  The Park's Maritime Research Center houses archival and research materials that make up the largest maritime research collection on the North American Pacific coast. SAFR's museum collections include 48,000 items, ranging from buttons, medals, and scrimshaw to figureheads, ships' engines, and small boats.  ACE is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing rewarding environmental service opportunities for young adults and emerging professionals of all backgrounds to explore and improve public lands while gaining practical professional experience. The EPIC NPS Division works alongside the National Park Service across the United States, from Alaska to Puerto Rico, to support the NPS in its mission to ""preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations"" while providing career promoting individual placement opportunities.Position Description:  San Francisco Maritime seeks a postdoctoral fellow to conduct research and contribute to interpretation in one or more of three areas of focus: histories related to African American maritime, waterfront, and/or shipyard workers in San Francisco and Marin County; African American experiences on the Pacific Ocean and their relationships to maritime communities along the North American Pacific coast (preferably focused on San Francisco and the SF Bay region); the place of maritime San Francisco in the history of 19th- and 20th-century Black emancipation, liberation, and uplift. While a candidate with a Ph.D. in history or African American studies is an obvious fit for this position, SAFR welcomes applicants representing any humanities field. The Park is open to creative approaches to interpretive and educational products if the work is grounded in historically accurate research and scholarship. We also welcome, but do not require, interest in working with community groups and/or expertise and interest in digital humanities. Candidates who wish to incorporate SAFR's museum collections into their work would be welcome to do so.  Each NPS Mellon Humanities Postdoctoral Fellow will complete work in four areas. Fellows will (1) perform project-based research; (2) share research results; (3) produce and substantially contribute to interpretive and educational products; and (4) pursue career-focused work.  1) Project-Based Research: In Year One, under the guidance of the mentoring team, the Fellow will conduct research in relevant scholarly sources; visit and explore relevant archival and research collections in San Francisco and/or throughout the region; and conduct research that draws on the Fellow's expertise and interests as well as selected Fellowship themes. This would be the time for Fellows with an interest in community outreach to initiate and begin to build relationships with relevant organizations. At the end of Year One, the Fellow will consult with their mentorship team, as well as other subject matter experts as needed, to propose a project for their second year.  2) Sharing Research Results: The Fellow will produce an annotated bibliography of scholarly and archival sources that they have consulted and, if they identify other scholarly, archival, and community sources for further study, will also write up a list of those resources as well. In consultation with NPS mentors, the Fellow will disseminate their research in other forms, which might include in-person workshops, digital publications, conference participation, academic publications, or other interpretive media.  During the first year, the Fellow will prepare and present an informal ""work in progress"" talk for SAFR Interpretation, Education, and Cultural Resources staff, volunteers, and interns. This talk would introduce staff to the Fellow's disciplinary perspective and help us understand how that perspective shapes the Fellow's research. The talk would also provide insight into the Fellow's research, research process, and their preliminary findings and insights thus far. Our partners and others from nearby NPS units will be invited to attend. At the end of the first year, the Fellow will prepare and present a more formal, in-person presentation for all SAFR staff as well as those from nearby NPS units. The Fellow may also wish to give virtual, NPS-wide versions of their presentations. The Fellow will be expected to develop and sustain connections with program-provided mentors and host staff, associated NPS staff, members of their Fellowship cohort, and other Fellows across the tenure of the program. In addition to being provided mentorship and support themselves, the Fellow will have the opportunity to mentor others and to enrich staff knowledge by organizing events such as virtual speaker series and presentations. Twice a year, the Fellow will participate with their cohort and other Fellows in a virtual conference for NPS staff and partners to provide updates about their research. The Fellow will be responsible for tracking and reporting accomplishments and for supplying copies of interpretive, educational, and research products to their host and to the National Coordinator.  3) Interpretive and Educational Products: The fellow will work with mentors to plan and develop work that will help SAFR tell new stories that are relevant to the Park, its mission, its local communities, and visitors more broadly. Interpretive and educational projects might include, for example, a script for a guided interpretive tour or museum exhibit, a podcast, articles for NPS.gov, or other web-based digital product. Depending upon the Fellow's field, interests, and expertise, products might also be more creative. They might include, just for example, a community-based art or photodocumentary project. 4) Career-focused Research and Products: In consultation with their mentors, the Fellow will carry out a career-centered project. About 20 percent of the Fellowship will be dedicated to this scholarly work that advances the Fellow's career path. The Fellow will have opportunities to meet with Park employees across Interpretation and Cultural Resources and to shadow them in their daily duties.

Job Description
ReviewPoint Account Executive

What is ReviewPoint?

Think of your favorite local business. Odds are, you haven’t written them an online review and you wouldn’t be alone. In fact, only 5-10% of customers leave reviews but, when asked, almost 70% of customers do. Since most small businesses don’t understand the effect that online reviews and an accurate online profile can have on their business or they simply don’t have the time to manage them, ReviewPoint was developed as the solution.

ReviewPoint is a full-service, software tool that helps small businesses get more positive online reviews on websites like Google, Facebook, and Yelp. Since many small business owners are skeptical of new digital marketing strategies or just overwhelmed by the term SaaS, we put our customers first by offering high quality, white-glove services and lead our customers’ success.

Founded in 2020, ReviewPoint is on the ground floor and we’re itching to take over the online review market. Although early-stage, ReviewPoint has secured funding in order to provide long-term stability and scalability for our team and customers. While building a diverse, team-oriented, supportive culture, we’re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters who love exciting workdays and have a never-ending drive to build relationships and close deals. Great businesses are built by great people and so, simply put, we’re looking for those great people.

What you’ll do

Being an early-stage startup, this is a unique opportunity to flex your sales skills and be a part of building something great.

Successfully build, validate, and implement sales processes
Identify and test product-market fit across a variety of verticals
Foster personal relationships with clients to gain a deep understanding of our targets’ goals
Align customer objectives with ReviewPoint’s positioning
Work closely with product and customer success in cross-department initiatives 
Own the complete sales cycle from initial contact to closing a deal
Manage pipeline, sales activity and have the ability to accurately forecast

While strategy is important, the right candidate is a grinder who will drive outbound calling and email at scale.

Requirements

Self driven and results oriented 
Bachelor’s degree
Minimum of 1-3 years of outbound sales experience (preferably B2B software sales)
Experience with CRM software like HubSpot or Salesforce
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
A team player and fast learner
Highly organized with strong time management skills

Nice to haves

Demonstrated an aptitude to prospect and close new deals with small-sized local businesses
Background in building sales processes from the ground up
Experience successfully demoing software products
Strong understanding of commissions and quote based pay structures
Comfortable using popular sales software solutions (like Gong, SalesLoft, or ZoomInfo)

Benefits
Employer-paid benefits with multiple health plan options
Standard PTO (15 days)
Flex schedule once we’re back in office (3 days per week in office, 2 days remote)
401(k) 
Equipment and home office stipend
MAJOR opportunities for career growth at a fast paced, early-stage company

Vaxcyte Inc,"Associate Scientist I, Upstream Process Development",unspecified,"Job Description
Job Description

Company Profile:
Vaxcyte, Inc. (Nasdaq: PCVX) is a next-generation vaccine company seeking to improve global health by developing superior and novel vaccines designed to prevent some of the most common and deadly infectious diseases worldwide. Our exclusively licensed cell-free protein synthesis platform and our proprietary know how enable us to design and produce optimized protein carriers and antigens, the critical building blocks of vaccines, in ways that we believe conventional vaccine technologies cannot. Our pipeline includes pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, or PCV, candidates that we believe are the most broad-spectrum PCV candidates currently in development, targeting the $7 billion global pneumococcal vaccine market. Our lead vaccine candidate, VAX-24, is a preclinical, 24-valent broad-spectrum pneumococcal conjugate PCV with preclinical proof-of-concept demonstrating potential to replace the standard of care that we expect to advance into clinical trials in the second half of 2021. Our pipeline also includes VAX-XP, a PCV with an expanded breadth of coverage of at least 30 strains, including newly emerging strains responsible for invasive pneumococcal disease and antibiotic resistance; VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections; and VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease by targeting the keystone pathogen responsible for this chronic, oral inflammatory disease. We completed our initial public offering in June 2020, raising $287.5 million in gross proceeds.
Summary:
Vaxcyte is purposing the Xpress CF technology to produce best-in-class conjugate vaccines and novel antigen-based vaccines. For the production of best-in-class conjugate vaccines, Vaxcyte is conjugating antigenic polysaccharides to specific sites on a proprietary nnAA-containing polypeptide uniquely produced via the platform. The open cell-free system also permits manipulation of multiple parameters (pH, temperature, redox potential etc) that govern protein folding. High fidelity control of these conditions unlocks a cache of “tough to make proteins” by permitting the optimal folding of complex antigens into their most immunogenic conformation leading to the production of novel complex antigen-based vaccines.
Vaxcyte is looking for an energetic and talented individual to assist in the Upstream Process function within the Protein Process Development group. The successful candidate would partner with the other members of the PD team, collectively providing rigorous scientific leadership. 

Essential Functions:
Responsible for helping to develop robust, scalable, and cost-effective upstream (cell-free) procedures for the GMP manufacture of early and late stage clinical trial material
Assist in technology transfer activities for processes developed at Vaxcyte to external CMOs for GMP production
Require 80-90% time in the lab
Interface closely with the Research group, write detailed technical reports, make presentations to the development team, and author internal publications

Requirements:
BS in Biochemical or Chemical Engineering with 3+ years of industry experience; MS with 1+ years of industry experience
In-depth practical experience with microbial fermentation

Continuum Hospice,Volunteer,unspecified,"Overview

Come join our Continuum Hospice Volunteer Team! Are you caring and compassionate? Do you have a passion for helping others? Then we would love to have you as a hospice volunteer! 

Continuum Hospice's volunteers are provided the preparation and training they need to comfortably and successfully complete their chosen assignments. Some volunteers receive additional training based on their selected area of service. Continuum Hospice and Palliative Care has multiple office locations where we serve patients located in both the west and east side of the United States. Our primary area of coverage includes parts of California, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. 

Become a hero on your own terms
On your own time. In your own way. With your personality. Your ability to relate. Your own skills. Your way of solving a problem, sharing a story, helping somebody remember important moments in their lives.

You can be one of our volunteers
When you give us the precious gift of your time and interest, we give you a chance to make a real difference in someone's life. We train you, find you the right assignment and stand behind you as you grow.

Continuum Hospice provides professional care with a personal touch. We accomplish this by focusing on both the patient and their family. We will treat the disease process with medical expertise while emphasizing quality living, not only physically, but also psychosocially, emotionally and spiritually. Comfort, compassion and calming presence are the gifts we bring to this service, and we are honored to walk with the patient and loved ones through this special time.

VOLUNTEERS ARE NOT PAID EMPLOYEES AND DO NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR THEIR TIME. 

Responsibilities

Patient Care Volunteers are part of a patient's care team. They make home visits to offer companionship for patients and relief for caregivers. Examples of patient care volunteer opportunities include reading to the patient, assisting with a hobby, listening, running errands, or grocery shopping.

Organizational Volunteers do not work directly with patients and families. Examples of organizational volunteer opportunities include working in our offices to support our care team or help patients and families through indirect support, such as assisting with our Transitions program, creating special memories for holidays, patient birthdays and anniversaries, planting flowers or mowing a yard for a patient that is unable to continue doing so, and helping with other needs of our patients and families.

Musician Volunteers are professional musicians, choir members, music students and teachers, board-certified music therapists, band members, and more, to share music and brighten up the days of all those we serve. As a Music Volunteer you will be able to provide a beautiful presence through the comfort of your music to our patients, and provide peace to our front-line healthcare staff.

Pet Therapy Volunteers are a wonderful way to share comfort and compassion through interactions with Certified Therapy Pets and Hospice Patients. A visit from a therapy animal can bring an immense amount of joy, emotional support, and fulfillment to a hospice patient and their family members. Pet therapy has been proven to decrease pain and stress. No hospice experience necessary but the animal must be certified and up to date on all vaccinations.

Veteran Volunteers have the unique ability to relate and connect with other Veterans, which is why they are vital to ensuring our veteran patients get the extra attention they deserve. Veteran volunteers provide companionship (conversation/sharing stories, playing games, etc.), caregiver relief (to give direct caregivers a break), compassionate listening, and participation in Veteran pinning ceremonies. Veteran volunteers have invaluable insight and may be able to give stress reduction techniques to patients/caregivers, help recognize PTSD in patients, and help patients/caregivers identify and process grief.

ReviewPoint Sales Lead

What is ReviewPoint?

Think of your favorite local business. Odds are, you haven’t written them an online review and you wouldn’t be alone. In fact, only 5-10% of customers leave reviews but, when asked, almost 70% of customers do. Since most small businesses don’t understand the effect that online reviews and an accurate online profile can have on their business or they simply don’t have the time to manage them, ReviewPoint was developed as the solution.

ReviewPoint is a full-service, software tool that helps small businesses get more positive online reviews on websites like Google, Facebook, and Yelp. Since many small business owners are skeptical of new digital marketing strategies or just overwhelmed by the term SaaS, we put our customers first by offering high quality, white-glove services and lead our customers’ success.

Founded in 2020, ReviewPoint is on the ground floor and we’re itching to take over the online review market. Although early-stage, ReviewPoint has secured funding in order to provide long-term stability and scalability for our team and customers. While building a diverse, team-oriented, supportive culture, we’re looking for entrepreneurial self-starters who love exciting workdays and have a never-ending drive to build relationships and close deals. Great businesses are built by great people and so, simply put, we’re looking for those great people.

What you’ll do

Being an early-stage startup, this is a unique opportunity to flex your sales skills and be a part of building something great.

Successfully build, validate, and implement sales processes
Identify and test product-market fit across a variety of verticals
Foster personal relationships with clients to gain a deep understanding of our targets’ goals
Align customer objectives with ReviewPoint’s positioning
Work closely with product and customer success in cross-department initiatives 
Own the complete sales cycle from initial contact to closing a deal
Manage pipeline, sales activity and have the ability to accurately forecast

While strategy is important, the right candidate is a grinder who will drive outbound calling and email at scale.

Requirements

Self driven and results oriented 
Bachelor’s degree
Minimum of 5 years of outbound sales experience (preferably B2B software sales)
Minimum of 1 year of sales leadership experience
Experience with CRM software like HubSpot or Salesforce
Excellent written and verbal communication skills
A team player and fast learner
Highly organized with strong time management skills

Nice to haves

Demonstrated an aptitude to prospect and close new deals with small-sized local businesses
Background in building sales processes from the ground up
Experience successfully demoing software products
Strong understanding of commissions and quote based pay structures
Comfortable using popular sales software solutions (like Gong, SalesLoft, or ZoomInfo)

The students at PAU reflect the diversity of the region, are engaged in their education, and committed to improving the lives of others. The University sees diversity in its staff and faculty as very important to serving its diverse student body (or synonymous with inclusive excellence). PAU offers undergraduate and graduate programs with online, hybrid and residential options. PAU has an engaged faculty who make significant contributions to their fields and prepare future leaders who make a difference in the lives of individuals and communities. When you put all of this together, PAU creates a legacy of confident, competent, and compassionate professionals who are at the forefront of psychology and counseling and who move ahead in life by moving lives ahead.

Additionally, PAU supports faculty and post-doctoral research through grants and other sources of funding to fulfill our vision to improve the well-being of others and contribute to just and inclusive communities. 
The Center for LGBTQ+ Evidence-Based Applied Research (CLEAR) was founded by Dr. Peter Goldblum at Palo Alto University in 2007 with the vision that “every person – adult or child – will have access to the social and psychological resources necessary to construct affirming identities congruent with their deepest selves.” In the sixteen years since its inception, CLEAR has served a role of providing funding and support for faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows at Palo Alto University to conduct research advancing the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ populations. This support has also enhanced training on cultural competency to ensure that the next generations of clinical psychologists are prepared to meet the needs of these populations.

d-Matrix,Runtime Software Engineer,unspecified,"THE ROLE: RUNTIME SW ENGINEER

The Company 

If you are following the evolution of the leading approach in deep learning powered AI, the renaissance in NLP as well as the next disruption in computer vision, you likely know it's all about Transformer based models. They are powering neural nets with billions to trillions of parameters and existing silicon architectures (including the plethora of AI accelerators) are struggling to varying degrees to keep up with exploding model sizes and their performance requirements. More importantly, TCO considerations for running these models at scale are becoming a bottleneck to meet exploding demand. Hyperscalers are keen on how to gain COGS efficiencies with the trillions of AI inferences/day they are already serving, but certainly for addressing the steep demand ramp they are anticipating in the next couple of years. d-Matrix is addressing this problem head on by developing a fully digital in memory computing accelerator for AI inference that is highly optimized for the computational patterns in Transformers. The fully digital approach removes some of the difficulties of analog techniques that are most often touted in pretty much all other in-memory computing AI inference products. d-Matrix's AI inference accelerator has also been architected as a chiplet, thereby enabling both a scale-up and scale-out solution with flexible packaging options. The d-Matrix team has a stellar track record in developing and commercializing silicon at scale as senior execs at the likes of Inphi, Broadcom, and Intel. Notably, they recognized early the extremely important role of programmability and the software stack and are thoughtfully building up the team in this area even since before their Series A. The company has raised $44m in funding so far and has 70+ employees across Silicon Valley, Sydney and Bengaluru.

unspun,Textile Technician,unspecified,"Job Description
Job Description
About Us
unspun is a robotics and digital apparel company based in Emeryville, CA. Our mission is to reduce global carbon emissions by 1% through automated, localized, and intentional manufacturing. 
Recently included in Time's Best Inventions &amp; Fast Company's World Changing Ideas, unspun aims to rapidly transition the trillion-dollar apparel world into one that is more intentional, inclusive, and efficient by focusing on the overlap between sustainability and profitability— on-demand (and automated) manufacturing.
What We're Building
We’ve developed a proprietary and patented technology at the crossroads of 3D printing and automated textile manufacturing called 3D weaving. By skipping the flat 2D fabric stage, we can additively build custom apparel products from the ground up— straight from yarns to seamless final product. If the intersection of climate tech, robotics, fashion, and textile machinery get you excited, we’d love to talk!About You
You enjoy working on fast-paced and early-stage R&amp;D and bringing high quality products to market. You enjoy wearing multiple hats and switching between different contexts. You are capable of working independently and in a team while being flexible, self-motivated, and curious. You thrive on the lack of clear instructions at the beginning of ambitious projects, and your ability to learn, understand, and communicate clear instructions to others about a complicated process is one of your strengths. You have strong interpersonal skills and can help manage a complex testing program with competing needs from multiple sides of the organization. You probably love thinking about the things immediately around us, especially yarns, fabrics, clothing and the machines that make them. You enjoy daily challenges and relish the successes.
What You’ll Do
This Textile Technician (Hardware) role will split time across 3D weaving machine operation, support, AND build phases. We're looking for someone who has prior textile machinery experience, but also is game to jump in and help with machine builds and assembly help as needed. 
As part of the early technician team at unspun (growing from 4 to 8 teammates), you will be a core member operating, building, and supporting a completely new manufacturing process. We’re looking for someone with a few years of hands-on industry experience already, and someone who is excited about the risks and rewards of joining an early-stage startup.

Support 3D weaving material development and production
You’ll work with the Product and Hardware teams to create the world’s first 3D woven products! 
Help the technician team in hands-on assembly pushes, yarn preparation, and warp routing
(the next year is a big build push for us!)
Troubleshoot and resolve assembly-related issues 
(we're building some things for the first time... troubleshooting &amp; improving the process will be a core part of your work with us)
Maintain a safe and organized workspace 
(we're still an early team, but we're certainly growing— keeping things organized while we build is critical)
Use measurement equipment to troubleshoot and diagnose machine issues
(if you notice something isn't working right, can you help us figure out why?)
Collaborate with the engineering team on experiments and results
(everyone on the hardware team works closely with each other as we build, test, and improve these machines)
Identify and communicate suggested improvements to designs, documentation, or processes
(pretty soon, we'll need a factory to be building LOTS of these machines... can you help us figure out the best way to perform each step?)
Work collaboratively on a team of technicians juggling multiple build projects
(our technician team is close-knit, and covers projects across assembly, R&amp;D, and machine operation... there's a lot going on!)
Requirements
2+ years of experience in Textile machinery, Textile Engineering, Materials Science, Technician work, or related fields
Strong problem-solving abilities and attention to detail
Prior experience operating hand tools, power tools, or basic machinery
Knowledge of textile fibers and yarns
Strong verbal and written communication skills... this is a team sport!
Work on-site in Emeryville from 9a - 6p, M-F
Ability to work on your feet for extended periods, perform occasional repetitive tasks, and occasionally lift up to 50 lbs
Bonus Points:
Familiarity with industrial scale looms
Manufacturing and factory experience
Knowledge of basic statistical concepts as applied to experimentation
Experience in CAD
Experience in fast-paced, early stage R&amp;D projects
Experience working directly with vendors and suppliers
Experience with textile manufacturing

If you don't meet all of the requirements listed above, but can make up for it with a voracious passion to learn how to do so, we strongly encourage you to apply.
Benefits
Compensation: $67,000 - $80,000 per year + 0.2% - 0.4% equity, depending on experience
Full-time, W2 salary with a self-regulated vacation policy
Comprehensive (gold &amp; platinum) health/dental/vision insurance (or equivalent annual cash bonus if already insured elsewhere)
Company-sponsored 401k
Monthly gym membership or relevant online education grant of up to $150/month
Pre-tax commuter benefits
Weekly team lunches
Generous equity in a venture-backed, early-stage startup.
